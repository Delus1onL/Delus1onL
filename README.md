Hello, Delus1on_L here. I'm working on a decomp of a game at the moment, so yeah. I am interested about learning code,
so I hope that means I'll be productive and hopefully, will learn more as time goes on. I am also, at the moment,
involved and helping with Splatoon Legends. My role is the decomp of Sploon. That is what I will mainly have here. 

Reach out to me on Discord. I will post a reference to that soon. My DMs will be open.

Reach out on YouTube as well. I will post this soon, too.

I hope what you find here is helpful!
